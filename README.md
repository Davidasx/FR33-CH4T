Welcome to one of the only unlimited free GPT-4o online chat!

This is a platform where you can enjoy nearly unlimited ChatGPT usage.

The site is at: [https://free-chat.davidx.us.kg](https://free-chat.davidx.us.kg)

Try it out now! No configuration is ever needed beforehand!

The UI is based on my open-source project [flask-gpt](https://github.com/Davidasx/flask-gpt). However, to prevent abuse, code for free-chat are not open to the public. Apolgies if I've caused any inconvenience.


## Important Notice

As this is a free project, abuse may be unavoidable. Although this project provides a really high limit of questions per day, the limits will still appear if there is a high number of users. This project is currently open to the public but, if a limit is ever reached one day, it will turn into a invitational project until I work to raise the limits.

I will NOT track your activities while using free-chat. However, I hope that you do not spam, to the benefits of the whole community of users.

## Features

- Sync between multiple devices with a unique UUID.
- No extra login is required -- if you're using it for the first time, the UUID will be automatically generated for you.
