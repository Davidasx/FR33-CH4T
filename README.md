Welcome to one of the only (nearly) unlimited free GPT-4o online chat!

This is a platform where you can enjoy nearly unlimited ChatGPT usage. It also supports models like LLaMa and Claude Haiku, but some features are lacking or malfunctioning.

The site is at: [https://free-chat.davidx.us.kg](https://free-chat.davidx.us.kg)

Try it out now! No configuration is ever needed beforehand!

The UI is based on my open-source project [flask-gpt](https://github.com/Davidasx/flask-gpt). However, to prevent abuse, code for free-chat are not open to the public. Apolgies if I've caused any inconvenience.

## Important Notice

As this is a free project, abuse may be unavoidable. Although this project provides a really high limit of questions per day, the limits will still appear if there is a high number of users or some users that are abusing it. This platform is currently open to the public but, if large amounts of abuse are seen, it may turn into a invitational platform.

I will NOT track your activities while using free-chat. However, I hope that you do not abuse, to the benefits of the whole community of users.

If everybody use this reasonably, this platform will run stably for a few years.

## Features

- Sync between multiple devices with a unique UUID.
- No extra login is required -- if you're using it for the first time, the UUID will be automatically generated for you.
- Fast and authentic response from GPT-4o.
- Search online with DuckDuckGo to get the latest information.
- Support stream response -- finally!

## Working in Progress

- Improve UI appearance. (Working hard on the upstream project flask-gpt...)
- Support multi-line input and (potentially) visual input.
- Create a better account and session management system.
